      AskHistorians: A New Vision for the Digital Humanities
    </h1>
    <p>
      AskHistorians was founded in 2011 as the digital humanities project that provides a tightly-regulated, bigotry-free space for the public to engage with historical professionals and grassroots historians. It has since grown to encompass a panel of over three hundred experts, monthly traffic over 1,500,000 people, a popular podcast, and a presence on Twitter, Facebook, and at academic conferences.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <h2>“…Answers that are in-depth, comprehensive, and supported by up-to-date research”</h2>
		  <p>	  
	   We are distinguished by our high standards and commitment to user-driven content. Visitors bring their questions about history, and expert historians provide answers in accessible and engaging language. A team of moderators reviews answers to ensure they adhere to our core principles: in-depth, comprehensive, and supported by up-to-date scholarship. If you have never visited AskHistorians before, or are unfamiliar with how the site works, our <a href="how-to.html">How To Guide</a> provides an excellent way to familiarize yourself with the site.
    </p>
		  <p>
		  <h2>A Public Voice in Public History</h2>
		  <p>
		Our Q&A approach places the public in control of public history. Panelists’ areas of expertise reflect traditional subdivisions of academic history, such as “Ancient Egypt: Gender & Society” or “Western Fashion History, 1700-1900.” But readers’ questions reflect arise out of more organic ways to think about history, resulting in investigations like “What is the history of late-night drunk snacking?” and “Did Socrates even lift?”
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  <h2>Improving Historical Literacy</h2>
		  <p>At the same time, our mission includes improving historical literacy, not just historical knowledge. Our initiatives include a recurring methodology series, Monday Methods, that has spotlighted topics like Indigenous approaches to doing history, the Annales school, and the importance of empathy in historical research. We also offer a substantial booklist of high-quality recommended reading in a full range of topics, emphasizing books that are available and affordable beyond academic libraries.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  <h2> Advocacy for Public Humanities</h2>
		  <p>AskHistorians exists to break down the artificial barriers among historical professionals, grassroots historians, and the public. Thus, while we are neither a political organization nor formally affiliated with academia, our mission includes advocacy in both directions. We promote the benefits of public engagement for professional historians at conferences and through face-to-face and online outreach. We offer suggestions to readers on how they can support the health of the humanities in the public sphere.</p>
		  <p>
		  <h2>AskHistorians IRL</h2>
		  <p>Over it existence, the AskHistorians team has presented panels at several conferences to help educate the wider historical profession about our mission, and make the case that it is an invaluable community for historical outreach to the general public. Past Conference Panels have included:</p>

<li>American Historical Association's 2016 Annual Meeting: <a href="conferences/aha2016.html">"AskHistorians": Outreach and Its Challenges in an Online Space</a></li>

<li>National Council of Public History's 2017 Annual Meeting: <a href="conferences/ncph2017.html">Democratizing the Digital Humanities?: The "AskHistorians" Experiment in User-Driven Public History</a></li>

<li>American Historical Association's 2020 Annual Meeting: <a href="conferences/aha2020.html">Historians on the Battleground of Social Media: Lessons from Eight Years of AskHistorians</a></li>
