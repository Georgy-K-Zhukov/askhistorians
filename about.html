      AskHistorians: A New Vision for the Digital Humanities
    </h1>
    <p>
      AskHistorians was founded in 2011 as the digital humanities project that provides a tightly-regulated, bigotry-free space for the public to engage with historical professionals and grassroots historians. It has since grown to encompass a panel of three hundred experts, a subscriber base of 930,000, a popular podcast, and a presence on Twitter, Facebook, and at academic conferences.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <h2>“…Answers that are in-depth, comprehensive, and supported by up-to-date research”</h2>
		  <p>	  
	   We are distinguished by our high standards and commitment to user-driven content. Visitors bring their questions about history, and expert historians provide answers in accessible and engaging language. A team of moderators reviews answers to ensure they adhere to our core principles: in-depth, comprehensive, and supported by up-to-date scholarship.
    </p>
		  <p>
		  <h2>A Public Voice in Public History</h2>
		  <p>
		Our Q&A approach places the public in control of public history. Panelists’ areas of expertise reflect traditional subdivisions of academic history, such as “Ancient Egypt: Gender & Society” or “Western Fashion History, 1700-1900.” But readers’ questions reflect arise out of more organic ways to think about history, resulting in investigations like “What is the history of late-night drunk snacking?” and “Did Socrates even lift?”
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  <h2>Improving Historical Literacy</h2>
		  <p>At the same time, our mission includes improving historical literacy, not just historical knowledge. Our initiatives include a recurring methodology series, Monday Methods, that has spotlighted topics like Indigenous approaches to doing history, the Annales school, and the importance of empathy in historical research. We also offer a substantial booklist of high-quality recommended reading in a full range of topics, emphasizing books that are available and affordable beyond academic libraries.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  <h2> Advocacy for Public Humanities</h2>
		  <p>AskHistorians exists to break down the artificial barriers among historical professionals, grassroots historians, and the public. Thus, while we are neither a political organization nor formally affiliated with academia, our mission includes advocacy in both directions. We promote the benefits of public engagement for professional historians at conferences and through face-to-face and online outreach. We offer suggestions to readers on how they can support the health of the humanities in the public sphere.</p>
